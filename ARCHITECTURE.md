# ROOTED Community — Application Architecture

ROOTED Community is the heart of the ROOTED Operating System.

It is:
- Public  
- Educational  
- Trust-driven  
- Safety-driven  
- Local-first  

It is NOT a marketplace vertical.

## 🛑 Architectural Non-Negotiables

- No monetization in Kids Mode

- No ads  
- Sanctuary/rescue entities remain non-commercial  

Community is a **public good** vertical.
